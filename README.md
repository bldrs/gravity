## Building leaders to design a resilient society

We are exploring how we imagine, design, and build the future together.

There is a mysterious force that holds the world together. Buckminster Fuller talks about how light, as radiation, casts a shadow. However, gravity does not cast a shadow. He said that love is metaphysical gravity.

We are building a world that works for 100% of life. We are focusing our time, energy, and resources on reimagining our social architecture.

To build is to love.
