## How might we create an interface for navigating metaphysical gravity?

On Monday, I had a meeting to experience an onboarding ritual for holoptic that involved a simple prayer.

I am sorry. I forgive you. Thank you. I love you.

The experience was scheduled for 45 minutes to an hour.

The thought occurred to me that we rely on technology to try to reduce suffering. However, technology often has a numbing effect. We have become so disconnected from nature that we have come to believe we are separate from it. We are awakening to a greater awareness of the harm and destruction we have caused by creating such a distance between ourselves and the suffering we cause by our need for more.

Getting out of the way and letting go is a posture that changes our relationship to Universe. Taking time to notice, to observe, to listen, and to connect is a transformative experience.

If each of us could commit to this ritual as a practice and daily habit, how might that change our relationships to each other? Could we recognize that we are one, rather than separate and divided?
